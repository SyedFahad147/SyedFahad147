### 🚀 About Me

💻 I’m a Front-End Developer with over 2.5 years of hands-on experience specializing in creating dynamic, scalable, and high-performance web applications. I have a deep passion for transforming complex concepts into intuitive, responsive, and engaging user interfaces that deliver seamless user experiences.

⚙️ My technical toolkit is built around React JS, Next JS, JavaScript, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Material UI (MUI), complemented by a solid understanding of RESTful API integration and modern front-end development best practices. I have experience working in both agile startup environments and structured development teams, allowing me to adapt quickly to new challenges and technologies.

✨ I’m particularly skilled at:

Building reusable, modular components and scalable front-end architectures.

Crafting pixel-perfect, responsive designs using Tailwind CSS and MUI.

Integrating APIs and handling asynchronous data flows efficiently in React and Next.js applications.

Optimizing web performance and enhancing accessibility to improve overall application usability.

Collaborating closely with designers, product managers, and backend engineers to align UI/UX with business goals.

🚀 I thrive in dynamic environments where continuous learning, clean code, and thoughtful problem-solving are valued. I’m passionate about keeping up with the latest trends in the front-end ecosystem and continuously refining my skills to deliver high-quality, user-centric products.
